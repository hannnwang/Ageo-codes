# Ageo-codes
Synthetic examples and some other codes related to the paper "Ageostrophic corrections for power spectra and waveâ€“vortex decomposition". 
Contains: 
1) Code verifying the wave-vortex decomposition algorithm applied to 1D synthetic data, as shown in section 3.3 in the paper. What comes within it is the code to calculate the ageostrophic QG spectrum from 1D track data. 
2) Small program that calculates the ageostrophic QG spectrum in the Boussinesq system, as shown in equation (C1) in the paper. The input for this calcualtion needs to be 3D. 
3) Example showing that the rotational and divergent vortex can be correlated when the Fourier coefficients are not independent to each other, corresponding to appendix A in the paper.
