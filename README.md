# Ageo-codes
Synthetic examples and the code applied to data related to the paper "Ageostrophic corrections for power spectra and waveâ€“vortex decomposition", to appear on Journal of Fluid Mechanics. 
Contains: 
1) Code verifying the wave-vortex decomposition algorithm applied to 1D synthetic data, as shown in section 4.3 in the paper. What comes within it is the code to calculate the ageostrophic QG spectrum from 1D track data. 
The corresponding main program: practise_washingcycle_verify.m
2) Code verifying the 1D algorithm, which corresponds to section 3.3 in paper.
The corresponding main program: practise_Cphit_from_Cpsit_noise.m

I'm using Matlab 2019a for these codes. All the programs can be run within minutes on a reasonably good laptop. When you run them, please make sure that everything in this repository is copied into your Matlab path; especially, do not forget the stuff in fftstuff and the Hankel Transform package. 

PLEASE do not hesitate to contact me if you are confused about anything. (Email: hannnwangus@gmail.com)
